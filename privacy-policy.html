  <h1>NocturneVPN ‚Äì Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 2025-08-25</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how NocturneVPN (‚Äúwe‚Äù, ‚Äúus‚Äù, ‚Äúour‚Äù) collects, uses, and shares information when you use our mobile application and related services (the ‚ÄúService‚Äù). By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Policy.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <h3>1.1 Account Information</h3>
  <p>If you sign in (e.g., with Google/Firebase), we may collect your user ID, display name, and email address to create and manage your account, synchronize app data (e.g., coin balance/history), and enable premium features.</p>

  <h3>1.2 Usage Data and Device Information</h3>
  <p>We may collect app usage data, device identifiers (e.g., Android Advertising ID where permitted), IP address, app version, and crash logs for analytics, performance, and security.</p>

  <h3>1.3 VPN Connection Data</h3>
  <p>Our priority is your privacy. We operate under a minimal logging policy to run an effective VPN service while collecting the least amount of data possible.</p>
  <p>To provide and maintain the Service, we may collect the following connection data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Connection Timestamps:</strong> Date and time your VPN session starts and ends.</li>
    <li><strong>Server Choice:</strong> The VPN server location you connect to (e.g., USA, Japan).</li>
    <li><strong>Aggregate Data Transferred:</strong> The total amount of data transferred during your session (e.g., 500 MB).</li>
    <li><strong>Originating IP Address:</strong> Processed temporarily during your session to prevent abuse and for troubleshooting but not stored after you disconnect.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>We never collect, log, or store:</em></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your browsing history or any websites you visit.</li>
    <li>The content of your internet traffic.</li>
    <li>DNS queries made while connected to the VPN.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1.4 Ads and Monetization</h3>
  <p>The Service may display ads (e.g., Google AdMob). Ads may be personalized or non-personalized depending on your consent and device settings. Ad networks may collect or receive device and usage data to serve and measure ads, subject to their policies. If you decline personalized ads, you will still see ads, but they may be less relevant.</p>

  <h3>1.5 Purchases and Subscriptions</h3>
  <p>If you purchase premium features via Google Play Billing, Google processes your payment details. We receive purchase tokens and product information to enable and verify your entitlement. We do not receive or store your full payment information (e.g., credit card numbers).</p>

  <h3>1.6 Coins and Rewards</h3>
  <p>The app may implement a coin/reward system. We may store your coin balance and history in local storage and/or in cloud storage (e.g., Firebase/Firestore) linked to your account to persist across devices.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide and maintain the Service (including VPN connectivity and premium access).</li>
    <li>Authenticate users and sync data across devices.</li>
    <li>Display and measure ads; manage consent choices.</li>
    <li>Process purchases and manage entitlements.</li>
    <li>Monitor performance, detect abuse, and improve reliability.</li>
    <li>Communicate important updates and respond to support requests.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Sharing of Information</h2>
  <p>We may share information with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> (e.g., Firebase, Google AdMob, Play Billing) to operate essential features.</li>
    <li><strong>Analytics and crash reporting tools:</strong> to improve app quality.</li>
    <li><strong>Law Enforcement or Authorities:</strong> Only in response to a legally binding request (e.g., subpoena or court order) from an authority with proper jurisdiction. Since we do not log browsing activity or traffic content, we do not have this data to provide.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not sell your personal data or VPN browsing content.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Account Information is retained as long as your account is active.</li>
    <li>VPN connection metadata is retained for up to 30 days, then permanently deleted.</li>
    <li>Originating IP addresses are processed only during active sessions and not stored.</li>
    <li>Billing and purchase records may be retained longer to comply with legal and tax obligations.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You may request earlier deletion of your account data, subject to applicable law.</p>

  <h2>5. Your Choices and Rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ads and Consent:</strong> Manage ad preferences in the app or device settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Access/Deletion:</strong> Request access to or deletion of your account data by contacting us.</li>
    <li><strong>Regional Rights:</strong> Depending on your location (e.g., EEA, California), you may have additional rights.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Security</h2>
  <p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information. However, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

  <h2>7. Children‚Äôs Privacy</h2>
  <p>The Service is not directed to children under 13 (or the digital age of consent in your region, if higher). If you are under this age, you may only use the Service with parental/guardian consent and supervision.</p>

  <h2>8. International Data Transfers</h2>
  <p>Your information may be processed and stored on servers provided by trusted third parties (e.g., Google Firebase) located outside your country of residence. Where required by law, we take steps to ensure appropriate safeguards for international transfers.</p>

  <h2>9. Changes to this Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Material changes will be indicated by updating the ‚ÄúLast Updated‚Äù date or via in-app notice. Your continued use of the Service after changes means you accept the updated Policy.</p>

  <h2>10. Account & Data Deletion</h2>

    You have the right to request deletion of your account or specific personal data:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Delete Account:</strong> To permanently delete your account and associated data, email us at
